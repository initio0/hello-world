Verify the Remote URL

Check the remote URL of your repository by running:
bashgit remote -v

If the URL starts with https://github.com/, Git is using HTTPS, and you need to configure it to use the token.
To authenticate with your token over HTTPS, you can modify the remote URL to include the token directly:
bashgit remote set-url origin https://<GITHUB_TOKEN>@github.com/<username>/<repository>.git
Replace <GITHUB_TOKEN> with your actual token, <username> with your GitHub username, and <repository> with the repository name.

Note: Including the token in the URL is not the most secure approach, as it exposes the token in plain text. A better approach is to use a credential helper (see below).
